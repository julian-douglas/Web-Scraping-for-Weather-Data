# Web Scraping for Weather Data

I am particularly interested in weather and climate, and it is vital that we use sophisticated techniques to analyse climate data so that we can track climate change and assess the hazards and risks of it.

So, I thought what better way to showcase my web scraping skills than to use some weather data? I used the [World Weather website](https://world-weather.info/), and looked at the temperatures ranging from 2015 to 2021 in London. I wanted to use more datapoints, but it was actually really hard to find a website that contained data for a lot of years. 

In this project I used Beautiful Soup to scrape weather data, then use Pandas to create a dataframe, and then Matplotlib/Seaborn to create some nice plots. 

Feel free to give me some feedback.
